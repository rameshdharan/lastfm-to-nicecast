Last.fm + Nicecast Integration
-----------------------------

This is a simple python script obtains the currently playing track from
last.fm and writes it to the NowPlaying.txt file read by Nicecast for adding
song information to a stream.

I use it in conjunction with the RadioEnhancer Google Chrome extension and
Pandora, in order to broadcast my Pandora stream to my Media Center HTPC
running iTunes in order to activate the iTunes Visualizer for my Pandora
stream.
